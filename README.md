# Fight for offers!
This repo is mainly used to record the effort I make for getting an offer.

## Coding everyday challenge!
The repo contains my solutions and reviews of the algorithm tests I did every day.

## Learning and review!
The knowledge of computer science and IT would be easily forgotten if no review were provided. Also, the ability to learn quickly in life is important in this rapidly changing society. Here, I would also record the knowledge I may need for getting offer.

## Type faster!
Typing training website: [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/)

## Code readable code!
Code in a unified style. Also learn a lot from the [Google Style Guides](https://github.com/google/styleguide). Strongly recommand to spend a day to  understand it.

But I don't really like the 2 spaces setting. Anyway, I would follow it.
