### 001

1. Trading space for speed. Use Hashmap to get an $O(1)$ lookup time complexity.
2. Hashmap in C++ is call `unordered_map`

### 002

Read the question carefully! First you need to understand what the question is asking!

### 003 

use `to_string()` to make it easy.

### 009

1. use `max()` to simplify your code;
2. Use the concept of sliding window.

### 013

1. Use `switch` instead of `unordered_map` to save memory.
2. Think about the question upside down.
